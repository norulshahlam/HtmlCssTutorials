    we will learn on how to:

    Position items. this is very important to understand how it works

    static	    Default value. not affected by tblr properties
    absolute	Positioned relative to its parent element that is 
                positioned 'relative'	
    fixed	    Positioned relative to the viewport (browser window)
    relative	Positioned relative to its normal position, 
                so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to 
                the element's LEFT position. this must be set in order for the item to be moved.
    sticky  	Positioned based on the user's scroll position
                A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
                It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - 
                then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

    z-index     The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
                An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
                Note: z-index only works on positioned elements:
                (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).

    <div id="box-1" class="box">box-1 is set to relative, z-index=1. by default it is most top left from the body</div>
    <div class="container">
        <div id="box-2" class="box">box-2 is inside blue container div. To position an element relative to its parent,
            the parent must be set to position: relative, and child must be set to absolute in order for this to work.
            now it is not set any position so it will go most top left towards the parent div
        </div>
        <div id="box-3" class="box">box-3 is inside blue container div. To position an element relative to its parent,
            the parent must be set to position: relative, and child must be set to absolute in order for this to work
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="box-4" class="box">box-4 position:fixed it will stay fixed in ref to the parent element ie inside body tag
    </div>
    <div id="box-5" class="box">box-5 position:sticky, top:0px. this toggles
        between relative and fixed which means will stick to its preceding
        markup & then sticks when it is being scroll up to the top of the page
        at the top of the window (top:0px)
    </div>
