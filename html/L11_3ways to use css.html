    in this lesson we will learn:

    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

    1. Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

    2. Internal CSS
    Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add <style> tag 
    in the <head> section of your HTML document.

    Disadvantages of Internal CSS:
    Adding the code to the HTML document can increase the page’s size and loading time.

    3. External CSS
    With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external
    .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device. 
    This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large 
    website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.

    Disadvantages of External CSS:
    Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.
    Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site’s download time.
  
    Inline CSS
    Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. 
    For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each 
    HTML tag, without using selectors.
    This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs 
    to be styled individually. Managing your website may become too 
    hard if you only use inline CSS.

    Disadvantages of Inline CSS:
    Adding CSS rules to every HTML element is time-consuming and 
    makes your HTML structure messy.
    Styling multiple elements can affect your page’s size and download time.
