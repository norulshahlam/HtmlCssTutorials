    learn about transitions.
    but what are the diff with using animations?

    Transition:

    Needs a triggering element (:hover, :focus etc.)
    Only 2 animation states (start and end)
    Used for simpler animations (buttons, dropdown menus and so on)
    Easier to create but not so many animation/effect possibilities
   
    Animation @keyframes:

    It can be used for endless animations
    Can set more than 2 states
    No boundaries
