    pseudo selector
        A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
        For example, it can be used to:
        Style an element when a user mouses over it
        Style visited and unvisited links differently
        Style an element when it gets focus

        Pseudo-classes can be combined with CSS classes:

        a.highlight {
             color: #ff0000;
        }

        +

        a:hover {
             color: #ff0000;
        }

        =

        a.highlight:hover {
             color: #ff0000;
        }

        this mean, on hover, use this style

    links
    buttons

    cursor: pointer - change the cursor to pointer (the finger icon) when mouse is on the element

    text-decoration: none; - no line is drawn, and any existing decoration is removed.
