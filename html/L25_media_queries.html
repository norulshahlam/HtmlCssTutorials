    1. media queries
    
    Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
    It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

    2. Different Stylesheets for Differently Sized Browser

    known as “resolution dependent layouts”. 
    Single website, different CSS files for rearranging a 
    website to take advantage of the size available.

    There is a W3C standard way of declaring them. 
    One way is to test the “device-width”, like this:

    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-device-width: 800px)" href="800.css" />

    The above code will apply the 800.css styling to the document 
    only if the device viewing it has a width of 800px or wider. 
    And… supports “media queries” in this way.
