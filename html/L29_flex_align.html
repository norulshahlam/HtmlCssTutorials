 The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, 
 was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, 
 and as a method that could offer space distribution 
 between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. 
 This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, 
 which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guide

 how to align flex box

flex-direction - arrange item in row or column
align-items - align items to either left/centre/right for column,
or top/centre/bottom for row
justify-content - This defines the alignment along the main axis. 
It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex 
items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their 
maximum size.
