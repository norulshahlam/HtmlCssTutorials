<!-- 
    CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

    What are CSS Animations?

    An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

            once done iterating, u can set it to its final style

            Defines whether or not the animation should
            play in reverse on alternate cycles.
