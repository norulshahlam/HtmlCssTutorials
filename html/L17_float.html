<!-- 
    we will learn about:
    floats and how to align 2 section to each other.

    Floats were used before Flexbox and Grid to create entire layouts. 
    It isn't used as much anymore, but you may encounter it in legacy code.

    The float property essentially "floats" an element to the 
    left or right of its container.

    It also removes that element from the normal flow of the document. 
    For example, if you float an image that has a caption, 
    its caption will end up filling up space around the image. The image is removed from the normal flow of the document.

    You can clear a float by using the clear property on the 
    element you wish the document to return to its normal flow from. 
    If you added the clear property for the image caption, the caption 
    would adjust itself underneath the image and that is where the 
    document would return to its original flow.

        <!-- 
            Note: Elements after a floating element will flow around it. 
            To avoid this, use the clear property or the clearfix hack
         -->
        <div class="clr"></div>

        <div id="box-4" class="box">
            <h3>the clr class ABOVE do not allow floating elements on both sides</h3>
            <p>
                The clear property is used to specify that which side of floating elements are not allowed to float. It
                sets or returns the position of the element in relation to floating the objects. If it is not used, then
                this div will go up and behing these flaoting elements. try to remove the class=clr to see the diff.
