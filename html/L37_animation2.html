    CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

    What are CSS Animations?

    An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
    You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
    To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
    Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

    for this lesson we wil only focus % of the animation duration
    eg if duration is 10 sec, we can define a portion of that to do something
